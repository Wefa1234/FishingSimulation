# FishingSimulation
HPC-course assignment 2.

Implementing a parallel map generator and a parallel fishing simulation. Generating ’realistic’ maps with connected
landmasses and surrounding water elements on quadratic 2D cartesian grids. In a simplified version of the generated
maps groups of fish swim around in an ocean while two fishing boats move around independently fishing for them.
