## Unix commands
Unix
Clone repository to Unix with the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wefa1234/FishingSimulation.git
```
After editing use
```bash
git add filename
```
When all the edited file has been added use
```bash
git commit -m "message describing your commit goes here"
```
Finaly use command 
```bash
git push origin
```
Github username and password are needed when pushing but for some reason, the password ain't good enough so a personal access token is needed. [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) is instructions for that. [Here](https://gist.github.com/jtallant/2932800) is also good summary of Unix and git commands.
